# Hibernate: Basic CRUD

## Description
Experiment with concepts of Hibernate and ORM (Objectâ€“relational mapping). In this project, we can see how:
* Configure Hibernate in the XML file (/hibernate-basic-CRUD-demo/src/hibernate.cfg.xml)
* Create the entity in which this Java class or its objects will be mapped to the database's table (entity/...)
* Map objects to tables of MySQL (demo/...)
* Interact with the database by the primary key
* Interact with the database by the persistent object
* Interact with the database by the SQL query
